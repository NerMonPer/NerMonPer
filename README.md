### Buzzing salutations to everyone! 
I'm a PhD student in Ecology working with plant-pollinator interaction networks. 

My research focuses on how climate change and land-use is affecting the network and its potential to rewire. Further analyses that I'm doing relate to our ability to predict plant-pollinator interaction networks, assessing this at a European scale.

I'm working on these goals with my thesis supervisor Ignasi Bartomeus (network rewiring) and my stay supervisor Timoth√©e Poisot (network predicitons). 

*What I am interested about*
- I'm a passionate of insects and specifically wild bees. 
- Scientific vulgarization through graphics and illustrations is my other passion. Along with my thesis I try to create interesting content on wild bee biology and behaviour to spread the love for these animals. Did you know there are more than 22000 bee species around the world?

*What I want to learn*
- I want to expand my knowledge on scripting languages and go outside the R confort zone. Learn the basics of Julia and Python are my new challenges.
